# Idea Box: Mod 1

For this project we were asked to recreate the comp of the Turing Idea-Box. Idea-box is a way for users to save their ideas. The site has functionality that allows for viewing ideas, creating ideas, deleting existing ideas, editing existing ideas, changing qualities, filtering by text and importance, and showing most recent ideas. 

## Motivation

As a third project, Idea Box expanded on previously developed HTML and CSS skills and vanilla JavaScript. It further tested my ability to design a UI that perfectly matched the comp and was interactive with the user. The best part of creating this project was learning to delegate small tasks on a team of three and creating group norms by using a DTR (Define The Relationship) document.

### Our Biggest Challenge

Our biggest challenge with this project was saving our ideas to local storage. After researching saving to local stroage, revisiting our class lecture notes, and asking classmates and upper mod students, we were able to succeed in saving our ideas to local storage, as well as edits and quality changes. 

### Our Biggest Success

Our biggest success was getting all of our quality buttons functional, and getting our input and text areas to clear when ideas had been saved.
